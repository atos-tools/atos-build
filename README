=================
ATOS build system
=================

This is the top level build system for ATOS tools and its dependencies.


Development Build
=================

For building and developing into ATOS, follow the steps below:
  /bin/bash (bash is actually only needed for the . ./setenv.sh below)
  git clone gitolite@codex.cro.st.com:atos/atos-build.git
  . ./setenv.sh
  ./dependencies extract
Extracting component 'atos-utils'
Extracting component 'proot'
Extracting component 'jsonpath'
Extracting component 'jsonlib'
Extracting component 'argparse'
Extracting component 'docutils'
  make -j 4

After this initial build, one can get into atos-utils and develop/push as usual:
  cd atos-utils
  make check

For each new session do not forget to do in top level atos-build directory:
  . ./setenv.sh


Release Build
=============

In order to create a full ATOS release with support for all platforms, follow
the steps below:
  Ensure that you are on a x86_64 recent system (kernel > 2.6.14)
  Ensure that you have at least 2Gb disk space available
  git clone gitolite@codex.cro.st.com:atos/atos-build.git
  ./dependencies -c release extract
  . ./setenv.sh
  make -j 4 release  

This will create in the curerent directory a atos-<version>.tgz binary
archive.
